Text: ##Objective
Soho House has established an aspirational global lifestyle brand, attracting culturally engaged audiences worldwide. In order to connect with these audiences, multiple brands approach Soho House to create one off and long term partnerships. 

##Action
We established distinctive brand partnership strategies for each of the Soho House sub brands. This work enabled the business to define the value and potential of partnerships when discussing potential deals with partner brands. 

These strategies became the backbone of flexible proposal templates which have been taken forward by the business and used in multiple pitches and presentations to brands across the world of fashion, finance, automotive and luxury goods.

##Result
This new approach to brand partnerships secured a two year deal with a major luxury fashion brand and overall has transformed Soho Houseâ€™s ability to propose coherent and buyable partnership opportunities.
