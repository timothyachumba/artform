Text: ##Objective
Virgin Money recently acquired CYBG and are in the process of merging the two banks and creating a new, unified brand with a positive, future facing and community focused positioning. The new brand has been designed to revolutionise public perception of Virgin Money itself and expectations of the industry as a whole. With the goal of engaging and inspiring a diverse range of stakeholders with the new brand, Virgin Money asked us to deliver a presentation at an internal conference of 200 executives.

##Action
We researched, wrote and delivered a presentation entitled The Age of Acceptance to the packed audience of C-Suite and director level executives. This presentation was a rallying cry and a challenge to the business to embody the positive, inclusive and welcoming spirit of the new brand. The key message of the presentation was that it is time for brands to provide a way out of the polarised, partisan politics and culture of the past 10 years, and in doing so future proof their place in peopleâ€™s lives now and in the future.


##Result
The presentation provided an inspiring, cultural perspective and helped to ensure the positive adoption of the rebrand. We are now working with Virgin Money to establish how the new brand and cultural focus can be brought to life across multiple touchpoints.
